* Replace cp + rm with mv to gain more speed and preserve cpu-io-wait
+ Subdir savepoints so I can use one repository for any number of reflections
+ Allow for relative paths (enables one config for different machines)
+ Remove stash directory if its empty (on reinit)
+ Add Logger (Reflection::Support.log)
+ Rails: Run migrations after apply
+ After command callbacks: Apphunk
+ List existing reflections in client side
  + Allow to apply any (git) version, not just the latest
+ Add cli option use tmp-apply (removes ~/.reflection/apply-dir after command) 
+ Allow collection of assets from Akamai and/or CloudFront (hm.. does that make sense?)
+ Add option to output --version
- Remove ruby-git dependency
